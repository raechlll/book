	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a global clinical problem in recent years. With the discovery of antibiotics, infections were not a deadly problem for clinicians as they used to be. However, worldwide AMR comes with the overuse/misuse of antibiotics and the spread of resistance is deteriorated by a multitude of mobile genetic elements and relevant resistant genes. This review provides an overview of the current situation, mechanism, epidemiology, detection methods and clinical treatment for antimicrobial resistant genes in clinical important bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, acquired AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.},
