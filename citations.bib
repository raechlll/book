  abstract = {The incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant E. coli strains has risen in the past years. Antibiotic resistance in E. coli is often mediated by acquisition and maintenance of plasmids. The study of E. coli plasmid epidemiology and genomics often requires long-read sequencing information, but recently a number of tools that allow plasmid prediction from short-read data have been developed. Here, we reviewed 25 available plasmid prediction tools and categorized them into binary plasmid/chromosome classification tools and plasmid reconstruction tools. We benchmarked six tools (MOB-suite, plasmidSPAdes, gplas, FishingForPlasmids, HyAsP and SCAPP) that aim to reliably reconstruct distinct plasmids, with a special focus on plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes. We found that two thirds (n = 425, 66.3\%) of all plasmids were correctly reconstructed by at least one of the six tools, with a range of 92 (14.58\%) to 317 (50.23\%) correctly predicted plasmids. However, the majority of plasmids that carried antibiotic resistance genes (n = 85, 57.8\%) could not be completely recovered as distinct plasmids by any of the tools. MOB-suite was the only tool that was able to correctly reconstruct the majority of plasmids (n = 317, 50.23\%), and performed best at reconstructing large plasmids (n = 166, 46.37\%) and ARG-plasmids (n = 41, 27.9\%), but predictions frequently contained chromosome contamination (40\%). In contrast, plasmidSPAdes reconstructed the highest fraction of plasmids smaller than 18 kbp (n = 168, 61.54\%). Large ARG-plasmids, however, were frequently merged with sequences derived from distinct replicons. Available bioinformatic tools can provide valuable insight into E. coli plasmids, but also have important limitations. This work will serve as a guideline for selecting the most appropriate plasmid reconstruction tool for studies focusing on E. coli plasmids in the absence of long-read sequencing data.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a global clinical problem in recent years. With the discovery of antibiotics, infections were not a deadly problem for clinicians as they used to be. However, worldwide AMR comes with the overuse/misuse of antibiotics and the spread of resistance is deteriorated by a multitude of mobile genetic elements and relevant resistant genes. This review provides an overview of the current situation, mechanism, epidemiology, detection methods and clinical treatment for antimicrobial resistant genes in clinical important bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), extended-spectrum {$\beta$}-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, acquired AmpC {$\beta$}-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.},
