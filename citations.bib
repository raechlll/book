	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a global clinical problem in recent years. With the discovery of antibiotics, infections were not a deadly problem for clinicians as they used to be. However, worldwide AMR comes with the overuse/misuse of antibiotics and the spread of resistance is deteriorated by a multitude of mobile genetic elements and relevant resistant genes. This review provides an overview of the current situation, mechanism, epidemiology, detection methods and clinical treatment for antimicrobial resistant genes in clinical important bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, acquired AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.},

	abstract = {The sensory drive hypothesis of animal signal evolution describes how animal communication signals and preferences evolve as adaptations to local environments. While classical approaches to testing this hypothesis often focus on preference for one aspect of a signal, deep learning techniques like generative models can create and manipulate stimuli without targeting a specific feature. Here, we used an artificial intelligence technique called neural style transfer to experimentally test preferences for color patterns in a fish. Findings in empirical aesthetics show that humans tend to prefer images with the visual statistics of the environment because the visual system is adapted to process them efficiently, making those images easier to process. Whether this is the case in other species remains to be tested. We therefore manipulated how similar or dissimilar male body patterns were to their habitats using the Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm. We predicted that males whose body patterns are more similar to their native habitats will be preferred by conspecifics. Our findings suggest that both males and females are sensitive to habitat congruence in their preferences, but to different extents, requiring additional investigation. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence for testing hypotheses about animal communication signals.
Highlights- Neural style transfer was used to test preferences for patterns in a colorful fish- Results trend in support of the processing bias hypothesis, a component of sensory drive- This study demonstrates the use of generative AI for animal behavioral studies},

	abstract = {In 1958, Edward L. Kaplan and Paul Meier collaborated to publish a seminal paper on how to deal with incomplete observations. Subsequently, the Kaplan‐Meier curves and estimates of survival data have become a familiar way of dealing with differing survival times (times‐to‐event), especially when not all the subjects continue in the study. “Survival” times need not relate to actual survival with death being the event; the “event” may be any event of interest. Kaplan‐Meier analyses are also used in nonmedical disciplines.
            The purpose of this article is to explain how Kaplan‐Meier curves are generated and analyzed. Throughout this article, we will discuss Kaplan‐Meier estimates in the context of “survival” before the event of interest. Two small groups of hypothetical data are used as examples in order for the reader to clearly see how the process works. These examples also illustrate the crucially important point that comparative analysis depends upon the whole curve and not upon isolated points.
